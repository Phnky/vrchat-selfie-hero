# VRChat Selfie Hero
_This project is now in redundancy for VR users due to the addition of cameras in the latest patch 2018-04-24_
_However desktop users can still find a use for this as they do not have access to the selfie-cameras._


Instructions:

This asset will allow your group to take pictures with everyone included. It summons a screen in front of the user, and the user can do a gesture to take a picture.

This asset comes with a prefab object that contains the screen, the camera, the texture, the needed materials, and two animations required for it to work.

To use this asset:

1. Drag the prefab into your Armature.
2. Include both animations in your Custom Animation Override.
3. Disable the camera game object and its camera component.
